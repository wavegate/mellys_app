# Melly's App

Problems faced/concepts practiced:

- First application using Django deployed on Heroku
- Timezone aware/naive for handling users from different timezones because Django models are timezone-aware whereas Python datetime is timezone-naive
- Image masking
- Drawing an arc using CSS (only works on single color backgrounds)
