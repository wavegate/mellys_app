# Melly's App

(Please give Heroku's hobbyist dyno a minute to load)

Problems faced/concepts practiced:

- First application using Django deployed on Heroku
  - Navigating Djagno's MVT style (I've used Flask previously so it felt pretty similar)
  - W3Schools and Mozilla web docs for tutorials into Django, learning about server-side programming and website security
  - Read the 12-Factor App
- Timezone aware/naive for handling users from different timezones because Django models are timezone-aware whereas Python datetime is timezone-naive
- Image masking
- Drawing an arc using CSS (only works on single color backgrounds)
- Conversion from polar to Cartesian coordinates to correctly position icons on the clock
